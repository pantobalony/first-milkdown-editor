# Milkdown Editor Development Session

This document captures the context and progression of the development session for this Milkdown React editor project.

## Overview

We created a React implementation of the Milkdown Crepe WYSIWYG Markdown editor, featuring a responsive UI, block editing capabilities, and various styling fixes.

## Session Timeline

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created a Vite React TypeScript project
   - Installed Milkdown dependencies: `@milkdown/crepe`, `@milkdown/react`, etc.
   - Set up basic project structure

2. **Editor Implementation**
   - Created initial MilkdownEditor component
   - Encountered issues with blank white page
   - Created a simplified test component to isolate issues

3. **Debugging & Fixes**
   - Fixed CSS styles to ensure proper rendering
   - Addressed toolbar visibility issues with CSS overrides
   - Implemented MutationObserver to keep toolbar visible
   - Added a "Fix Toolbar" button as backup

4. **Block Editing Enhancements**
   - Fixed the drag handle (6-dot icon) positioning for headings
   - Added the "+" button to the left of drag handles
   - Enhanced CSS for block hover states

5. **Layout Improvements**
   - Made the editor fill the entire browser window
   - Added window resize handling for dynamic resizing
   - Improved scrolling behavior

6. **GitHub Integration**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created README and .gitignore
   - Set up GitHub remote
   - Pushed code to GitHub

## Key Components

1. **App.tsx**
   - Main application container
   - Controls for Markdown retrieval and editor reset
   - Window resize handling

2. **MilkdownEditor.tsx / SimpleEditor.tsx / BasicEditor.tsx**
